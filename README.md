# Hi there, I'm Aayush ðŸ‘‹

A 2nd year Mathematics & Statistics student at the University of Nottingham.
Avidly solving problems, whether it be building trading strategies or designing creative game development solutions.

## What I Do

- **Quant Trading:** Currently a trading/research intern at a crypto shop; market-making cryptoderivatives - turning data into smart money moves and understanding a lot more about the function of D1 products as I do!
- **Game Development:** From fun experiments on Roblox using Lua, to passion projects in Python, I craft interactive experiences that merge logic with imagination.

  *Quantitative Trading/Research Intern*
  Working on market-making/stat arb algorithms for crypto futures!

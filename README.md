# Hi there, I'm Aayush ðŸ‘‹

A 2nd year Mathematics & Statistics student at the University of Nottingham.
Avidly solving problems, whether it be building trading strategies or designing creative game development solutions.

## What I Do

- **Quant Trading:** Currently a trading/research intern at a crypto shop; market-making cryptoderivatives - turning data into smart money moves! 
- **Game Development:** From fun experiments on Roblox using Lua, to passion projects in Python, I craft interactive experiences that merge logic with imagination.

## My Toolbox
I count on these handy tools the most!

## Outside the Code

When I'm not diving into market trends or debugging my latest project, or studying, you'll find me:
- **Swimming or playing table tennis** just because that's what I enjoy.
- **Reading** up on everything from tech trends to the latest romance novel or whatever.
- **Building** the latest lego set.

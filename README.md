## Outside the Code

When I'm not diving into market trends or debugging my latest project, or studying, you'll find me:
- **Swimming or playing table tennis** just because that's what I enjoy.
- **Reading** up on everything from tech trends to the latest romance novel or whatever.
- **Building** the latest lego set.
